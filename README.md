# Lung-Cancer-Classification
Lung Cancer

Overview
This repository contains code and resources for building a lung cancer classification model using CNNs. The goal is to predict whether lung tissue images are normal or cancerous
Dataset
It includes 5000 images across three classes:

Normal Lung Tissues
Lung Adenocarcinomas

I started reading data using open-cv2 and os
then represent some information about data (EDA)
then build model CNNs and predict test data
then print confusion matrix and classification report
